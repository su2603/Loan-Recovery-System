# üìò Loan Recovery System

## Overview

The **Loan Recovery System** is a modular, machine-learning-enhanced framework designed to optimize loan collection strategies. It provides a Streamlit interface for users to upload data, perform analysis, and visualize actionable insights across borrower risk segmentation, pricing optimization, anomaly detection, and more.

## üîß Components & Features

### 1. `LoanRecoveryStrategyModel` (Base Class)

Located in: `optimisingLoanRecovery.py`

#### Key Functions

- **`load_and_prepare_data(df)`**: Cleans, encodes, and scales input data.
- **`segment_borrowers(n_clusters=4)`**: Uses KMeans to segment borrowers into risk groups.
- **`train_recovery_optimization_model()`**: Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict optimal collection methods.
- **`develop_early_warning_system()`**: Uses Gradient Boosting to predict default risk.
- **`calculate_roi_optimization()`**: Calculates ROI for various collection strategies.
- **`predict_optimal_strategy(borrower_data)`**: Suggests the best method for a given borrower.

### 2. `AdvancedLoanRecoverySystem` (Extended Class)

Located in: `advancedstrategies.py`  
Inherits from `LoanRecoveryStrategyModel`

#### Advanced Capabilities

- **`assign_risk_segments()`**: Assigns risk tiers based on payment behavior.
- **`implement_survival_analysis()`**: Predicts time-to-recovery using Cox Proportional Hazards modeling.
- **`detect_anomalous_cases()`**: Uses Isolation Forest to flag unusual borrower patterns.
- **`implement_neural_predictor()`**: Neural network for classifying borrower risk.
- **`dynamic_pricing_optimization()`**: Determines optimal settlement amounts using profit-based optimization.
- **`analyze_seasonality_patterns()`**: Simulates and visualizes seasonal recovery trends.
- **`implement_network_analysis()`**: Analyzes borrower interconnections and how network position affects risk.
- **`create_recovery_dashboard()`**: Generates a multi-panel dashboard visualizing KPIs.
- **`generate_action_recommendations()`**: Provides strategy recommendations based on analysis.

### 3. `StreamlitLoanRecoverySystem` (Streamlit Integration)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### Run Locally

```bash
streamlit run loanRecoverySystemApp.py
```

### Upload Your Data

- Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`
- Or generate synthetic demo data in-app

## ‚úÖ Recommendations Engine

Based on all model outputs, the system generates:

- Risk-adjusted strategies per borrower
- Optimal recovery methods
- Expected ROI and time-to-resolution
- Anomaly alerts
- Seasonal timing suggestions

## üìå Notes

- All models use synthetic enhancements if necessary (e.g., missing target columns)
- Modular architecture allows easy integration of new strategies or data
- Visualization is optimized for interpretability and executive decision-making
